# CloudNative3üåè

## Inspiration
CloudNative3 uses the function of Chainlink oracle to realize decentralized security control, which is the key to realize the migration of Web2 applications to Web3 environment. By using Chainlink oracles, CloudNative3 can ensure data reliability and security.

## What it does
CloudNative3 can provide a solution for seamlessly migrating Web2 applications to Web3 environments, supporting decentralized cloud computing, decentralized service orchestration governance, and decentralized zero-trust security control

## How we built it
### Chainlink Oracle
Decentralized security control through Chainlink oracles, including cloud computing platform control engine, data response, etc.

### Proof of communication
Based on TLSNotary combined with Chainlink external adapter to realize communication proof, which can ensure the security and reliability of communication

### Smart Contract
Build decentralized security control based on Chainlink smart contracts, support external adapters combined with TLSNotary to realize the communication proof of the request model

### Decentralized cloud computing platform
Including technologies such as container cloud, service grid governance, zero-trust security control, and decentralized security control of on-chain oracles

## Challenges we ran into
Combining the decentralized cloud computing platform with the Chainlink oracle machine to ensure the authenticity and integrity of communication data.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
One of the proud achievements of CloudNative3 is its communication proof technology based on TLSNotary combined with Chainlink external adapter. TLSNotary is a technology based on Transport Layer Security (TLS), which can be used to verify the authenticity and integrity of data during communication.

## What we learned
1. Combine cloud native technology and blockchain technology through chainlink oracle
2. Through the combination of TLSNotary and chainlink external adapter, the communication is more secure

## What's next for CloudNative3
1. More stable and reliable chainlink oracle-based security controls
2. Smarter and more reliable service mesh governance
3. More efficient and secure container cloud
